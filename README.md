# karate_sample_docs
A sample project for Karate &amp; Java API tests

This README provides an overview of a generic sample project that demonstrates the use of Karate and Java for automated API and UI testing. This project serves as a template and guide for creating and running tests using Karate and Java in a testing environment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this sample project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Build and project management tool)
- [Karate](https://github.com/intuit/karate) (Karate API testing framework)
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
karate-sample-docs/
├── src/
| ├── test/
| | ├── java/
| | | ├── api/
| | | | ├── APITest.java
| | | ├── ui/
| | | | ├── UITest.java
├── pom.xml
├── README.md
...
```


- `src/`: This directory contains the project source code.
  - `test/`: Test code is organized under this directory.
    - `java/`: Java code for tests is stored here.
      - `api/`: Java classes for API tests.
      - `ui/`: Java classes for UI tests.
- `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration file.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/karate-sample-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd karate-sample-project
    ```

3. Install project dependencies using Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## API Testing
Karate is used for API testing and is integrated into Java classes. You can write your API test scenarios using Karate features in Java.

## UI Testing
UI tests are written in Java using your preferred UI testing framework (e.g., Selenium, Appium). You can create Java classes for UI tests and use them to interact with web or mobile applications.

## Customization
You can customize the project by adding more API and UI tests, updating dependencies, and configuring test data and environment variables.

## CI/CD Integration
To integrate this project into your CI/CD pipeline, you can use Maven to automate builds and test executions. Ensure that your CI/CD environment supports Java, Maven, and any other specific tools used in your project.

## Best Practices
Follow the principles of BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) when writing Karate scenarios.
Keep your tests focused, independent, and maintainable.
Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your project code.
Regularly update dependencies to benefit from the latest features and security patches.
